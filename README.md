# Subreddit-to-Google-Drive-using-BDFR-and-Google-Collab
It can download an entire subreddit to your drive without any data usage.

This method works on common web browser including Mobile and iOS devices. 
I'm an actual noob at this so don't judge me. Also I don't know if there's any licensing or copyright issue with this method. This code runs BFDR in your Google Collab. It copies the subreddit posts to your Google Drive. I did a bulk download of a subreddit to a folder and it worked fine for both videos and images. You should be able to run all bfdr commands with this.
Here's the method.

I have attached an ipynb file. Download it then upload it into your Google drive. Now go to https://colab.research.google.com/
Click on top left menu. Click on Open Notebook. Select Google drive. Click on the file.I have given you. It will open up. Now click on the execute signs one by one, connect your google drive, but wait for the green ticks. Also at the last command, put your subreddit name and path to where you want to drop those files. More detail on the last command is given below and also at BFDR page right here https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit
I suggest you read the method below if you're confused.
